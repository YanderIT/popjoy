## Refund Eligibility

### Quality Issues

We offer refunds for items that arrive with **quality defects or damage**. To be eligible for a refund due to quality issues, you must provide:

- **Clear photos**: Detailed images of the defect or damage
- **Order information**: Your order number and relevant details

The unboxing video is **required** to verify that the damage occurred during shipping or was present upon delivery, and not caused after receipt.

### Non-Refundable Situations

We **do not offer refunds** for the following reasons:

- Change of mind or buyer's remorse
- Items that have been opened without an unboxing video
- Items damaged after delivery due to customer handling
- Items that have been used, displayed, or altered
- Requests made after 14 days from delivery date

2. **Include** your order number, description of the issue, and the unboxing video
3. **Wait for review**: Our team will review your claim within 3-5 business days
